# OpenRewrite JBang Script Upgrade Workflow

This document outlines the incremental process for updating `rewrite-jbang/rewrite.java` to align with `rewrite-maven-plugin` releases, eventually targeting compatibility with OpenRewrite v8+ versions.

## Goal

Incrementally update `rewrite-jbang/rewrite.java`, aligning it feature-by-feature and dependency-by-dependency with the evolution of the `rewrite-maven-plugin`.

## Repositories

* **Working Repo:** `rewrite-jbang` (branch: `upgrade-deps`)
* **Reference Repo:** Local clone of `openrewrite/rewrite-maven-plugin`
* **Test Repo:** Any Java project that can be used to validate changes (e.g., `rules_antlr`)

## Documentation Maintenance Requirements

Always keep documentation in sync with code changes:

1. **README.adoc Updates:**
   * Any new features, command-line options, or behavior changes must be reflected in README.adoc
   * Document new options with clear descriptions of their purpose and default values
   * Update examples to demonstrate usage of new features
   * Review troubleshooting sections for relevance when fixing issues

2. **TODO Comments:**
   * Address TODO comments in the code when implementing related features
   * When resolving a TODO comment, update both the code and documentation

3. **Commit Documentation Together:**
   * Always include documentation updates in the same commit as code changes
   * Use "docs:" prefix for documentation-only changes
   * For mixed changes, use "feat:" or appropriate prefix and mention docs update in commit message

## Rules Maintenance Guidelines

Changes to these rules require special handling:

1. **Never Auto-Commit Rule Changes:**
   * Do NOT directly commit changes to `rules.md` or `.cursor/rules/global.mdc`
   * Instead, write changes to a temporary file (e.g., `temp_rules.md`)
   * Inform the user to manually copy the contents to `.cursor/rules/global.mdc`
   * Wait for the user to confirm they've copied the contents before proceeding

2. **Rule Update Process:**
   * Propose rule updates in a temporary file
   * Allow the user to review and apply the changes manually
   * User will commit the changes or instruct you to commit after they've applied them

## Process per Plugin Tag Increment

Let `P` be the previously processed plugin tag and `C` be the current tag being processed.

1. **Checkout Plugin Tag:**
   * Command: `cd /path/to/rewrite-maven-plugin && git checkout C`
   * AI can proceed automatically.

2. **Check Plugin BOM Version:**
   * Command: `cd /path/to/rewrite-maven-plugin && git show C:pom.xml | grep '<rewrite.version>'`
   * Note the BOM version `BOM_C` used in tag `C`.
   * AI can proceed automatically.

3. **Analyze Code Diff:**
   * Command: `cd /path/to/rewrite-maven-plugin && git diff P..C -- src/main/java/ | cat`
   * Identify API changes or refactorings relevant to the patterns/classes used in `rewrite-jbang/rewrite.java`.
   * AI can proceed automatically.

4. **Analyze POM Diff:**
   * Command: `cd /path/to/rewrite-maven-plugin && git diff P..C -- pom.xml | cat`
   * Confirm if the `<rewrite.version>` property changed between `P` and `C`.
   * AI can proceed automatically.

5. **Apply Code Changes (Requires Authorization):**
   * If step 3 identified relevant code changes:
     * Propose the specific `edit_file` commands for `rewrite-jbang/rewrite.java`.
     * **Wait for user authorization before executing edits.**

6. **Update Documentation (Requires Authorization):**
   * After any code changes from step 5:
     * Check if new features, options, or behavioral changes were introduced
     * Propose the specific `edit_file` commands for `README.adoc` to document these changes
     * Ensure any TODOs that were addressed are documented
     * **Wait for user authorization before executing edits.**

7. **Apply BOM Change (Requires Authorization):**
   * If step 4 confirmed `<rewrite.version>` changed to `BOM_C`:
     * Propose the `edit_file` command to update `//DEPS org.openrewrite:rewrite-bom:...` in `rewrite-jbang/rewrite.java` to `BOM_C`.
     * **Wait for user authorization before executing the edit.**

8. **Test Changes:**
   * Command: `cd /path/to/test/repo && jbang ../rewrite-jbang/rewrite.java --recipes org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat | cat`
   * Check for exit code 0 and absence of new compilation or runtime errors in the log output.
   * If the recipe makes changes to any files, restore them with `git checkout HEAD -- file/path`.
   * AI can proceed automatically *after* any authorized changes have been applied.

9. **Commit Changes (Requires Authorization):**
   * If steps 5, 6, or 7 resulted in authorized and applied changes, and step 8 passed:
     * Report success.
     * Propose `git add rewrite.java README.adoc && git commit ...` with a descriptive message.
     * Include both code and documentation changes in the same commit.
     * For mixed changes, use appropriate prefix like `feat:` and mention docs updates.
     * **Wait for user authorization before executing the commit.**

10. **Proceed to Next Tag (Requires Authorization):**
    * Report completion for tag `C`.
    * Identify the next tag `N`.
    * **Wait for user authorization before starting analysis for tag `N`.**

## Learnings from v8.x Upgrade

Based on our experience upgrading to OpenRewrite v8.49.0, here are key insights for future upgrades:

### Common API Changes to Watch For

1. **Method Signature Changes:**
   * Pay close attention to renamed or removed methods, especially in builder classes like `MavenParser.Builder`.
   * Example: In v8.48.0, the `.mavenConfig()` method was removed from `MavenParser.Builder`.

2. **Parameter Type Changes:**
   * Watch for changes in parameter types or return types that might cause compilation errors.
   * Many methods now return `List<>` with more specific generic types.

3. **New Required Parameters:**
   * Some methods may require additional parameters or have different parameter ordering.

4. **Dependency Management Changes:**
   * The OpenRewrite v8.x series integrates more modules into the BOM.
   * In v6.3.0, the `rewrite.kotlin.version` property was aligned with the main `rewrite.version`.

### Testing Strategies

1. **Compilation Testing:**
   * Always test compilation after API changes, even for simple BOM version updates.
   * Use `jbang rewrite.java --recipes org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat | cat` to verify compilation and basic functionality.

2. **Handle Test Side Effects:**
   * The test recipe may modify files in your test repository.
   * Always restore modified files with `git checkout HEAD -- file/path` to keep the test repository clean.

3. **Incremental Testing:**
   * Test after each individual change, not just after completing all changes.
   * If a test fails, roll back one change at a time to identify the problematic modification.

### Commit Message Conventions

1. **BOM Updates Only:**
   * `feat: Update OpenRewrite BOM to [version] (aligns with plugin [tag])`

2. **API Changes:**
   * `feat: Update OpenRewrite BOM to [version] and adapt to API changes (aligns with plugin [tag])`
   * Include details about significant API changes in the commit message body if needed.

## Specific v8.x API Changes to Know

1. **MavenParser Builder Changes:**
   * v8.48.0: Removed `.mavenConfig()` method
   * Usage pattern changed to more direct property configuration

2. **Metrics and Monitoring:**
   * v8.48.0: Simplified metrics handling, removed many RSocket-related classes and configuration

3. **Maven Scope Support:**
   * v8.49.0: Added Maven scope support to better control which sources are processed

## Future Upgrade Considerations

When upgrading beyond v8.49.0, follow these additional guidelines:

1. Check for deprecation warnings in the current version before upgrading
2. Review OpenRewrite release notes for major changes
3. Pay special attention to builder patterns as they frequently change
4. Monitor dependency changes closely, especially version alignment between components
5. Be prepared to update error handling as exception hierarchies may change
