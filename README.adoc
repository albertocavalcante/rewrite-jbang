# OpenRewrite as a jbang script

As an experiment from asking https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/discussions/834
I made this little script which is 97% same as the code found in https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-maven-plugin.

It lets you run OpenRewrite on any kind of project.

How to run: 

1. Install `jbang` (https://jbang.dev/download)
2. You can list recipes using:

[source,sh]
----
jbang rewrite@maxandersen/rewrite-jbang discover
----

3. Try run it with a few recipes: 

[source,sh]
----
jbang rewrite@maxandersen/rewrite-jbang --recipes org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CodeCleanup,org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat
----

You can also install the script using: `jbang app install  https://github.com/maxandersen/rewrite-jbang/blob/master/rewrite.java`
and just use `rewrite` directly, i.e.:

[source,sh]
----
rewrite --recipes org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CodeCleanup,org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat --dry-run
----

Limitations: 

* Use `--dry-run` to see proposed changes and generate a patch file (default: `./rewrite/rewrite.patch`).
* Remove `--dry-run` (or set to `false`) to apply changes directly.

== Key Options

`--recipes <list>`::
Comma-separated list of fully qualified recipe names to activate. Example: `org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat`

`--styles <list>`::
Comma-separated list of style configuration names to activate.

`--javaSources <list>`::
Comma-separated list of directories containing Java source files to scan. Defaults to `.`

`--discover-resources <boolean>`::
Attempt to discover resource files (`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.properties`, `.xml`) within the `--javaSources` directories. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to disable scanning for these files.

`--classpath <string>`::
Specify the classpath needed for type resolution in Java recipes. Use the system's path separator (e.g., `:` for Linux/macOS, `;` for Windows). Example: `--classpath "lib/dep1.jar:target/classes"`. Crucial for recipes that need to understand types from dependencies.

`--dry-run <boolean>`::
If `true`, lists changes and outputs a patch file instead of modifying files. Defaults to `false`.

`--fail-on-dry-run <boolean>`::
If `true` and `--dry-run` is active, the script will exit with an error code if any changes are detected. Defaults to `false`.

`--report <path>`::
Directory where the `rewrite.patch` file is written during a dry run. Defaults to `./rewrite`.

== Limitations

* Does not (yet) offer to automatically resolve dependencies from build files (use `--classpath` for manual provision).
* Totally just slammed together code a slow sunday morning!

== Development Notes

* Uses JBang for execution and dependency management.
* Dependencies are declared via `//DEPS` comments in `rewrite.java`.
